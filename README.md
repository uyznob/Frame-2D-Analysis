# Frame-2D-Analysis
A light Android-based application to analyze and post-process 2D frame for structural engineers.

The application allows the user to define several popular frames such as triangle, trapezoid roofs, and truss beams in the Input tab. From the defined geometry, the stiffness matrix for each element is computed correspondingly and assembled into the global stiffness matrix. The displacement then can be computed with the input load data. All of the results are shown in Output Tab.

Currently, the source is not completed, any contribution would be welcome.
